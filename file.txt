Problem Set 1 


Problem 1 breaking ciphers (6 points):
    1.1 - 
        1 - Frequency - The ciphertext's letter frequencies are:
        r: 84
        b: 68
        m: 62
        k: 49
        j: 48
        w: 47
        i: 41
        p: 30
        u: 24
        d: 23
        h: 23
        v: 22
        x: 20
        y: 19
        n: 17
        s: 17
        â†µ: 14
        t: 13
        l: 8
        q: 7
        o: 7
        e: 5
        a: 5
        c: 5
        f: 1
        g: 1

        From this we can guess that 'e' is encrypted as 'r', which is true

        2 - Decryption: 
        "BECAUSE THE PRACTICE OF THE BASIC MOVEMENTS OF KATA IS
        THE FOCUS AND MASTERY OF SELF IS THE ESSENCE OF
        MATSUBAYASHI RYU KARATE DO I SHALL TRY TO ELUCIDATE THE
        MOVEMENTS OF THE KATA ACCORDING TO MY INTERPRETATION
        BASED ON FORTY YEARS OF STUDY
        IT IS NOT AN EASY TASK TO EXPLAIN EACH MOVEMENT AND ITS
        SIGNIFICANCE AND SOME MUST REMAIN UNEXPLAINED TO GIVE A
        COMPLETE EXPLANATION ONE WOULD HAVE TO BE QUALIFIED AND
        INSPIRED TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT HE COULD REACH THE STATE
        OF ENLIGHTENED MIND CAPABLE OF RECOGNIZING SOUNDLESS
        SOUND AND SHAPELESS SHAPE I DO NOT DEEM MYSELF THE FINAL
        AUTHORITY BUT MY EXPERIENCE WITH KATA HAS LEFT NO DOUBT
        THAT THE FOLLOWING IS THE PROPER APPLICATION AND
        INTERPRETATION I OFFER MY THEORIES IN THE HOPE THAT THE
        ESSENCE OF OKINAWAN KARATE WILL REMAIN INTACT"

        ghlxiwiwtxgqadds

        1 - Decryption
        "if we all unite we will cause the rivers to stain the great waters with their blood"

        T is the most common letter, so we can take a guess that 'e' is 
        encrypted as 't'. That gives us a shift of 15, which is correct. 
        It only took ONE letter identified through frequency analysis to 
        crack the cipher.


Problem 2 - 
    1.4 -
        1 - 
        Each letter is encoded with 7 bits (128 possible characters), and the password has 8 letters.
        Becausae this question is asking "How many possible passwords are there with this info?"
        Therefore we can just take 128 to the power of 8
        The size of the key space is 128 ^ 8, or 72,057,594,037,927,936

        2 -
        Because 128 ^ 8 = 2 ^ 56. the corresponding key length in bits is 56

        3 -
        In this case, the size of the key space would be 26 ^ 8, so
        the corresponding key length in bits would be log(26 ^ 8), which 
        is 37.6

        4 -
        a -
        As we saw in step 2, the length of the password is 8, the key length in bits is 56.
        For the key length to be >= 128 bits, the length of the password would have to
        be 19 because the relationship between the key length in bits and the number of
        characters n is: key length / 7 = number of characters. Plugging 128 in to the 
        key length we see that 128 / 7 = 18.28 characters. Therefore the key length has to 
        be greater than or equal to 19

        b -
        As we saw in step 3, when it is just lowercase letters the corresponding 
        key length in bits is 37.6. When it is only lowercase letters, you need 4.7
        bits to represent each possible letter. The relationship between the key length 
        in bits and the number of characters would therefore be key length / 4.7 = number
        of characters. Therefore we have 128 / 4.7 = 27.2, so you need 28 letters


Problem 3 - 
    exercise 1.5 -
    1: 15 - (29 mod 13) = 15 - 3 = 12
    2: 2 * (29 mod 13) = 2 * 3 = 6
    3: 2 * (3 mod 13) = 2 * 3 = 6
    4: -11 * (3 mod 13) = -11 * 3 = -33


Problem 4 -
    Find the following multiplicative inverses if they exist, otherwise
    explain why they don't exist
    
    1: The multiplicative inverse of 1/4 in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] does 
    not exist because 4 is not a factor of 9
    2: The multiplicative inverse of 1/4 in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
    is 4 because 1/4 * 4 is 1 and 4 is a factor of 12
    3: The multiplicative inverse of 1/5 in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
    does not exist because 5 is not a factor of 12

Problem 5 -
    We consider the ring Z4 [0, 1, 2, 3]. Construct a table which describes the 
    addition of all elements in the ring to each other.

    1: The multiplication table for Z4 [0, 1, 2, 3] looks like
    * 0 1 2 3
    0 0 0 0 0
    1 0 1 2 3
    2 0 2 4 6
    3 0 3 6 9

    2: The addition and multiplication table for Z5 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] look like
    + 0 1 2 3 4              * 0 1 2 3 4
    0 0 1 2 3 4              0 0 0 0 0 0 
    1 1 2 3 4 5              1 0 1 2 3 4
    2 2 3 4 5 6              2 0 2 4 6 8
    3 3 4 5 6 7              3 0 3 6 9 12
    4 4 5 6 7 8              4 0 4 8 12 16

    3: Construct the addition and multiplication tables for Z6 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    + 0 1 2 3 4 5                    * 0 1 2 3 4 5
    0 0 1 2 3 4 5                    0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    1 1 2 3 4 5 6                    1 0 1 2 3 4 5
    2 2 3 4 5 6 7                    2 0 2 4 6 8 10
    3 3 4 5 6 7 8                    3 0 3 6 9 12 15
    4 4 5 6 7 8 9                    4 0 4 8 12 16 20
    5 5 6 7 8 9 10                   5 0 5 10 15 20 25

    4: The elements in Z4 [0, 1, 2, 3] without multiplicative inverses are
    [0, 3]. The elements in Z6 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] without multiplicative 
    inverses are [0, 2, 3, 4]. Z5 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] has multiplicative inverses
    for all elements except 0 because 5 is a prime number

Problem 7 -
    How many possible keys for Affine cipher exist in -

    Italian?:


    Russian?:

Problem 8 -
    An obvious approach to increase the security of a symmetric algorithm is to
    apply the same cipher twice, i.e.:
    y = ek2(ek1(x))
    As is often the case in cryptography, things are very tricky and results are often different from the expected and/ or desired ones. In this problem we show that a double
    encryption with the affine cipher is only as secure as single encryption! Assume two
    affine ciphers ek1 = a1x+b1 and ek2 = a2x+b2.
    1. Show that there is a single affine cipher ek3 = a3x + b3 which performs exactly
    the same encryption (and decryption) as the combination ek2(ek1(x)).
    2. Find the values for a3,b3 when a1 = 3,b1 = 5 and a2 = 11,b2 = 7.
    3. For verification: (1) encrypt the letter K first with ek1 and the result with ek2, and
    (2) encrypt the letter K with ek3.
    4. Briefly describe what happens if an exhaustive key-search attack is applied to a
    double-encrypted affine ciphertext. Is the effective key space increased?
