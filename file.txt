Problem Set 1 


Problem 1 breaking ciphers (6 points):
    1.1 - 
        1 - Frequency - The ciphertext's letter frequencies are:
        r: 84
        b: 68
        m: 62
        k: 49
        j: 48
        w: 47
        i: 41
        p: 30
        u: 24
        d: 23
        h: 23
        v: 22
        x: 20
        y: 19
        n: 17
        s: 17
        â†µ: 14
        t: 13
        l: 8
        q: 7
        o: 7
        e: 5
        a: 5
        c: 5
        f: 1
        g: 1

        From this we can guess that 'e' is encrypted as 'r', which is true

        IT IS NOT AN EASY TASK TO EXPLAIN EACH MOVEMENT AND ITS
        SIGNIFICANCE AND SOME MUST REMAIN UNEXPLAINED TO GIVE A

        AUTHORITY BUT MY EXPERIENCE WITH KATA HAS LEFT NO DOUBT
        THAT THE FOLLOWING IS THE PROPER APPLICATION AND
        INTERPRETATION I OFFER MY THEORIES IN THE HOPE THAT THE
        ESSENCE OF OKINAWAN KARATE WILL REMAIN INTACT"


    1.2 -
        Ciphertext: xultpaajcxitltlxaarpjhtiwtgxktghidhipxciwtvgtpilpit
        ghlxiwiwtxgqadds

        1 - Decryption
        "if we all unite we will cause the rivers to stain the great waters with their blood"

        T is the most common letter, so we can take a guess that 'e' is 
        encrypted as 't'. That gives us a shift of 15, which is correct. 
        It only took ONE letter identified through frequency analysis to 
        crack the cipher.


Problem 2 - 
    1.4 -
        1 - 
        Each letter is encoded with 7 bits (128 possible characters), and the password has 8 letters.
        Becausae this question is asking "How many possible passwords are there with this info?"
        Therefore we can just take 128 to the power of 8
        The size of the key space is 128 ^ 8, or 72,057,594,037,927,936

        2 -
        Because 128 ^ 8 = 2 ^ 56. the corresponding key length in bits is 56

        3 -
        In this case, the size of the key space would be 26 ^ 8, so
        the corresponding key length in bits would be log(26 ^ 8), which 
        is 37.6

        4 -
        a -
        As we saw in step 2, the length of the password is 8, the key length in bits is 56.
        For the key length to be >= 128 bits, the length of the password would have to
        be 19 because the relationship between the key length in bits and the number of
        characters n is: key length / 7 = number of characters. Plugging 128 in to the 
        key length we see that 128 / 7 = 18.28 characters. Therefore the key length has to 
        be greater than or equal to 19

        b -
        As we saw in step 3, when it is just lowercase letters the corresponding 
        key length in bits is 37.6. When it is only lowercase letters, you need 4.7
        bits to represent each possible letter. The relationship between the key length 
        in bits and the number of characters would therefore be key length / 4.7 = number
        of characters. Therefore we have 128 / 4.7 = 27.2, so you need 28 letters


Problem 3 - 
    exercise 1.5 -
    1: 15 - (29 mod 13) = 15 - 3 = 12
    2: 2 * (29 mod 13) = 2 * 3 = 6
    3: 2 * (3 mod 13) = 2 * 3 = 6
    4: -11 * (3 mod 13) = -11 * 3 = -33


Problem 4 -
    Find the following multiplicative inverses if they exist, otherwise
    explain why they don't exist
    
    1: The multiplicative inverse of 1/4 in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] does exist because there are not common factors other than 1 between
    4 and 9
    2: The multiplicative inverse of 1/4 in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] does exist because besides 1 there are not common factors between 4 and 11
    3: The multiplicative inverse of 1/5 in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] does not exist because besides 1 there are not common factors between 5 and 11

Problem 5 -
    We consider the ring Z4 [0, 1, 2, 3]. Construct a table which describes the 
    addition of all elements in the ring to each other.

    1: The multiplication table for Z4 [0, 1, 2, 3] looks like
    * 0 1 2 3
    0 0 0 0 0
    1 0 1 2 3
    2 0 2 4 6
    3 0 3 6 9

    2: The addition and multiplication table for Z5 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] look like
    + 0 1 2 3 4              * 0 1 2 3 4
    0 0 1 2 3 4              0 0 0 0 0 0 
    1 1 2 3 4 5              1 0 1 2 3 4
    2 2 3 4 5 6              2 0 2 4 6 8
    3 3 4 5 6 7              3 0 3 6 9 12
    4 4 5 6 7 8              4 0 4 8 12 16

    3: Construct the addition and multiplication tables for Z6 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    + 0 1 2 3 4 5                    * 0 1 2 3 4 5
    0 0 1 2 3 4 5                    0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    1 1 2 3 4 5 6                    1 0 1 2 3 4 5
    2 2 3 4 5 6 7                    2 0 2 4 6 8 10
    3 3 4 5 6 7 8                    3 0 3 6 9 12 15
    4 4 5 6 7 8 9                    4 0 4 8 12 16 20
    5 5 6 7 8 9 10                   5 0 5 10 15 20 25

    4: The elements in Z4 [0, 1, 2, 3] without multiplicative inverses are
    [0, 3]. The elements in Z6 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] without multiplicative 
    inverses are [0, 2, 3, 4]. Z5 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] has multiplicative inverses
    for all elements except 0 because 5 is a prime number


Problem 6 -
    1 - Decrypt the text - "falszztysyjzyjkywjrztyjztyynaryjkyswarztyegyyj"
    
    Decyption: firstthesentenceandthentheevidencesaidthequeen
    Author: Lewis Caroll

    This can be derived by frequency analysis.

Problem 7 -
    How many possible keys for Affine cipher exist in -

    Italian?:
        252 possible keys. You can derive the number of possible keys through the total number of characters (21) in Italian. While doing
        this, I learned about Euler's totient function. Euler's totient function counts the positive integers up to a given integer n that
        are relatively prime to n. This is identical to finding the possible values for a key. Because there are 21 letters, plugging 
        21 into the totient function returns 12. For the second key, we have (21 - 1) = 20 possible letters. Combining the two numbers we 
        have 12 * 20 = 252 possible keys.

    Russian?:
        660 possible keys. You can derive the number of possible keys through the total number of characters (33) in Russian. While doing
        this, I learned about Euler's totient function. Euler's totient function counts the positive integers up to a given integer n that
        are relatively prime to n. This is identical to finding the possible values for a key. Because there are 33 letters, plugging 
        33 into the totient function returns 20. For the second key, we have (33 - 1) = 32 possible letters. Combining the two numbers we 
        have 32 * 20 = 660 possible keys.

Problem 8 -
    An obvious approach to increase the security of a symmetric algorithm is to
    apply the same cipher twice, i.e.:
    y = ek2(ek1(x))
    As is often the case in cryptography, things are very tricky and results are often different from the expected and/ or desired ones. In this problem we show that a double
    encryption with the affine cipher is only as secure as single encryption! Assume two
    affine ciphers ek1 = a1x+b1 and ek2 = a2x+b2.
    1. Show that there is a single affine cipher ek3 = a3x + b3 which performs exactly the same encryption (and decryption) as the combination ek2(ek1(x)).

    A single affine cipher will take every letter in the alphabet and map 
    it to a different letter. Because every letter maps to one and only 
    one different letter, a double affine cipher can be expressed through 
    a single affine cipher. 

    2. Find the values for a3, b3 when a1 = 3, b1 = 5 and a2 = 11,b2 = 7.
    a3 = 33, b3 = 62

    To find a3, we can multiply a1 (3) and a2 (11), giving 3 * 11 = 33
    To find b3, we can take a2 * b1 + b2 = 11 * 5 + 7 = 55 + 7 = 62.

    3. For verification: (1) encrypt the letter K first with ek1 and the result with ek2, and (2) encrypt the letter K with ek3.

    Encrypting the letter a for ek1 , we have 0 * 3 + 5 mod 26 giving 5. 5
    corresponds to the letter f.    Encrypting the letter f for ek2 , we have 11 * 5 + 7 mod 26  = 62 mod 26 giving 10. This corresponds to the 
    letter k. This is the same as ek3. 

    4. Briefly describe what happens if an exhaustive key-search attack is applied to a double-encrypted affine ciphertext. Is the effective key space increased?
    
    Yes the effective key space is increased. Although a double affine cipher can be expressed through a single affine cipher, the effective 
    key space will still be increased because the key space will be the 
    key space for the first affine cipher multiplied by the key space for
    second cipher.
